The main festival is Maha Sivarathri in the month of Kumbha Malayalam Month which is celebrated with sudhi, Laksharchana, Ekadasa Rudrabhisheka, Chuttuvilakku, Niramala and other special poojas. There will be vilakku ezhunnellippu during night taking procession of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu on two caparisoned elephants and chenda melam for Sree Bhootha bali followed with Edakka pradhakshinam and nadhaswaram. It is a specialty that both Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu are taken on procession for Sree Bhootha bali. The functions will be concluded with a fireworks and followed with Krishnanattam, the classical performance, by the Krishnanattam troop of Guruvayoor Devaswom. </p><br>

				<p class="my-4">
An Athirudra Mahayagna, a rare yagna because of its complexity and magnitude, was conducted in this Temple under the main guidance of the then Thanthri of the temple Brahmasree Chennas Divakaran Namboodiripad and Brahmasree Chennas Dinesan Namboodhiripad for 11 days from 27th December 1997 to 6th January 1998 for the well-being of the whole mankind. This was the IInd time in Kerala in the recent past and Ist of its kind in terms of vast arrangements.

      				<p class="my-4">
There will be 11 Homa Kundas and 11 Vedic Scholars sitting around each Homa Kunda and performing Homas by chanting Sree Rudrams which is an important Mantra in Yajurveda. Performing homas in one Homa Kunda is known as Rudrakalasam. When it is performed in 11 Homa Kundas at a time is known as Maharudram. When this ritual is repeated for 11 days it becomes Athirudra Mahayagnam. 11 Kalasams in each Homa Kunda will be filled with water, milk, curd, ghee, honey, lime juice, gingelly oil, sugarcane juice, panchagavyam, panchamrutham and aswagandha water and sanctified by chanting mantras in the early hours daily. At the end of yagna in each day the Kalasams will be taken in processioin to sree Kovil and offer as Abhisheka on deity ceremonially. The yagna which starts at 5.30 in the morning will last for 4 hours and there will be 121 jeeva kalasams offered to the deity supported by 121 Vella nivedyams daily making a total abhisheka of 1331 Jeeva Kalasams and 1331 Upastharanams of rice nivedyam in 11 days.
